Hi,

For use:
- make a temp folder on our system (C:)
- copy all files to it
- run the script from an admin DOS console and execute this command (for x64 system):
  
  powershell -executionpolicy bypass C:\temp\PatchWinREScript_2004plus_Recommended.ps1 -PackagePath c:\temp\windows10.0-kb5034232-x64_ff4651e9e031bad04f7fa645dc3dee1fe1435f38.cab
  
Thanks and regards.
